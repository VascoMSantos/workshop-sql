* **IMPORTANT:** If you plan to do the practical part of the Workshop in your computer you should instal `docker` in your computer **BEFORE** the Workshop.



You should also clone this repository into your computer and try the instructions below before the workshop.



## Requirements

To follow the practical examples of the workshop, it is required to have installed:

- `docker`

Download the windows subsystem for linux and run it. Docker should work after a reboot.


## How to use 

To start the database container, open a terminal window or command prompt and use:

* `.\database.bat`  _(Windows)_

This command will print the IP address of the container, which you will need later

inside it:

* `psql -h <IP> -p 5432 -d workshop -U workshop -W`
